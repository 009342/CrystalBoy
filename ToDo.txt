TODO:
Allocate (mostly) all the memory at once, and localize the memory blocks as much as possible.
Try do do more buffer swapping, and less copying.
Split the UI requirements from the emulation requirements (eg. bilinear interpolation)
 - Plugin options shouldn't be exposed to the emualtion layer.
Enhance the new video renderer infrastructure to make it less awkward, and re-implement previous features.

 DONE:
 Totally rework the VideoRenderer infrastructure
 - Either let it do the rendering (by using the public API exposed by the lib)
 - Or do not call it a renderer anymore… More like a "VideoPresenter" or something like that.
 - Make it fully asynchronous if possible
